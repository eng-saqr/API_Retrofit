# API_Retrofit
I use Retrofit to connect to server and gson converter.
and get data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ it is open source .
this app is to get user title according to user id .
the user should input user id and it should be  from 1 to 100 in the EditText  and then click the button .
then get the user title and show it in TextView .
